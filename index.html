        <h1>Engineering Undergraduate Society Orientation Week 2020 Leader & Staff Contract; Frosh & Orientation 2020 </h1>
        <h5>As an Orientation Leader for McGill Orientation 2020, I hereby agree to the following for the entire duration of Orientation activities, starting on Monday, August 24th, 2020 and ending at noon on Monday, August 31st, 2020.
        </h5>
        <h5><u>CODE OF CONDUCT </u></h5>
          <h5><u>Full Participation and Availability</u></h5>
        <h5>I will attend each event listed on the schedule, including all training, and will participate fully in all events.</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>I will not do anything, including but not limited to consuming alcohol, which results in me being incapable of fulfilling my duties as an Orientation Leader/Orientation Staff (as specified in the signature form)
            </li>
              <li>I will ensure that participants in my group are able to contact me at all times and I will keep track of their whereabouts during Orientation while they are under my assignment/supervision.
              </li>
              <li>I will at all times gauge my group’s and participants’ reactions to events and activities and respond to any negative reactions with the individual(s) accordingly and respectfully to create an inclusive and safe space.
              </li>
          </ol>
        <h5><u>Safety and Well-Being of Everyone</u></h5>
        <h5>I will promote and create an emotionally and physically safe environment for all Orientation participants and members of the University and general public.
        </h5>
          <ol>
            <li>I will report any unsafe behavior by any Orientation Leader, Orientation Staff, or participant to an Orientation Coordinator. I will caution any Orientation Leader, Orientation Staff or participant that inappropriate behavior or actions may lead to disciplinary actions being taken against them.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h5>Responsible Drinking and Alcohol Safety
          </h5>
	       <h5>I agree that my actions and statements during Orientation will reflect the reality and mentality that Frosh is an event with drinking and not for drinking. 
              <h5>
          <ol>
            <li>I understand that the virtual context of Frosh 2020 results in the reality that I cannot offer immediate assistance in the event that a participant, Orientation Leader, Orientation Staff or Orientation Coordinator makes the choice to consume, or over-consume alcohol.
            </li>
            <li>I will not explicitly or implicitly pressure participants and/or Orientation Leaders and Orientation Staff to consume alcoholic beverages and will respect and accommodate to the reality that encouraging drinking in an online context puts participants at risk in a situation during which I cannot offer immediate assistance.
            </li>
            <li>I will not promote the consumption of alcohol through drinking games or otherwise, and will not allow the consumption of alcoholic beverages by participants under 18 years of age.
	3.2.1 I will be mindful that the laws and regulations concerning consumption of alcohol vary across the world for participants and will remind participants of such laws and regulations, should they be consuming under the appropriate mandated age restrictions.
            </li>
            <li>I myself will not consume alcohol to a point where I cannot perform and/or complete my duties and responsibilities as an Orientation Leader or Staff
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h5>Harm Reduction and Illegal Substances
          </h5>
        <h5>I shall not distribute nor promote any drug use or substance, legal or otherwise, to participants, and I will not possess or use any drug or substance, legal or otherwise, during Orientation at any time.</h5>
          <ol>
              <li>I will inform Orientation Coordinators if there is any indication that an Orientation Leader, Orientation Staff, a participant, or an outside party is distributing drugs, legal or otherwise.
              </li>
            <li>I will caution any Orientation Leader, Orientation Staff or participant who is using drugs, legal or otherwise, that their actions, while under the influence of such substances, may lead to disciplinary actions being taken against them.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h5>Professionalism and Appropriate Conduct
          </h5>
        <h5>I will behave in a manner that will uphold McGill’s reputation and the reputation of the Engineering Undergraduate Society.</h5>
          <ol>
              <li>I will maintain an appropriate relationship between myself and all Orientation participants and members of the University and general public.
              </li>
            <li>I will not engage in any behavior or attitude that is or has potential to be offensive, obscene, exclusive, or hurtful toward any Orientation participant, Orientation Leader, Orientation Staff or Coordinator or any member of the University or general public; this includes, but is not limited to, remarks or actions that disparage race, sex, gender, sexuality, physical or mental ability, age, class, religion, personal choices, etc.
            </li>
            <li>I will not write nor produce, nor allow others to write nor produce, offensive or obscene words or images on any Orientation Leader’s, Orientation Staff’s or participant’s t-shirt, bag, body, or any other publicly visible material or space.
            </li>
            <li>I will caution any Orientation Leader, Orientation Staff or participant who does the above that their actions may lead to disciplinary actions and/or legal action and/or monetary fines being taken against themselves and/or the participant’s Orientation Coordinators and/or the participant’s Orientation Leader.
            </li>
            <li>While in public areas, on or off campus, I will not partake in, nor encourage, nor lead the vocalization/chanting of any potentially obscene or offensive statements, songs, or chants including, but not limited to, “McGill Once, McGill Twice” or any anti-Concordia/other university song.
            </li>

          </ol>
          <h5><u>As I hold a position of authority, I acknowledge that there is a power dynamic and such, I will not have any intimate nor sexual contact with any Froshie or Coordinator under any circumstance. 
            </u></h5>
        <h5>CONSEQUENCES FOR MISCONDUCT</h5>
        <h5>I understand that failure to comply with any of the terms listed in the entirety of the contract may result in the removal of my Orientation Leader/Staff bracelet and the termination of my participation in Orientation activities. No money will be refunded. My bracelet may be removed at any time by an Orientation Coordinator or by McGill Security Services at their sole discretion. I consent to sharing my personal information (such as name, student ID and faculty) with other faculties, should I break this contract. Furthermore, any misconduct at any time which contravenes the Student Handbook on Student Rights and Responsibilities can result in disciplinary action by the McGill administration through the Office of the Dean of Students under an official Memorandum of Understanding between McGill and all Frosh organizations.
        </h5>
        <h5><u>Anyone who is added to the Frosh Involvement Restriction Policy will be barred from all future Orientation Week & Frosh events and this barring can be extended to all Faculty social events including: BdA, Detention Den, Blues Pub, The Ceilidh, 4à7, The Practice Room, Blues Pub, After Hours, Carnival, Hype Week, Faculty Graduation Balls, e-Week, Science Games, Faculty Olympics and others.
